# Python Code for Figures and Tables

This repository contains the Python code for generating the figures and tables used in the paper. Each script corresponds to a specific figure or table; running the scripts will produce the corresponding output.

- **Figure and Table Scripts**: Execute each script to generate the corresponding figure or table.
- **Cross Script**: Run the `cross.py` script to generate comparison plots between the proposed model and the standard cosmological model (Î›CDM).

Please ensure you have the required dependencies installed to reproduce the results.
